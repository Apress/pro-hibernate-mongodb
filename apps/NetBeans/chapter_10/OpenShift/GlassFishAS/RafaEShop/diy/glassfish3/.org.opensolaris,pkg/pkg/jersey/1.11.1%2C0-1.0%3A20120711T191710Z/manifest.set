set name=pkg.description value="Jersey core runtime libraries including some 3rd party dependencies.  Documentation and examples of Jersey were moved to a separate package, Jersey Examples And Documentation.  If you are about to upgrade Jersey, you might want to install that new package as well, otherwise Jersey examples and javadocs will get deleted.  Also please note, that from 1.0.3 version on, Jersey docs and examples get installed into <as_home>/glassfish/jersey directory instead of just <as_home>/jersey.  Jersey is the open source (under dual CDDL+GPL license) JAX-RS (JSR 311) Reference Implementation for building RESTful Web services.  But, it is also more than the Reference Implementation.  Jersey provides additional APIs and extension points (SPIs)  so that developers may extend Jersey to suite their needs."
